HOUSE RULES | CONSUMER FIRST
Here at CITTA ,  we believe that all influencer posts should be transparent and put consumers first. Therefore, both influencers and brands need to ensure that no campaign or post is false or misleading and must disclose the fact that the influencer is being paid by the brand. CITTA expects that all users comply with all applicable Laws and industry self-regulation relating to influencer marketing, including the guidelines laid out by ASCI (Advertising Standards Council of India). This means that all influencer marketing posts which are being facilitated through CITTA  should be transparent and labeled with appropriate disclosures, such as #Sponsored. We expect influencers and brands to keep themselves up to speed with the latest best practice on how to label influencer marketing posts in a transparent way in order to make sure that consumers are clear about the commercial nature of the sponsored posts.
HOUSE RULES FOR BRANDS
BE RESPONSIVE: Please appreciate the energy each Influencer has invested into their submission by responding to each one quickly. This will also prevent Influencers having a negative experience with your brand.
BE BRAVE: Resist the urge to micro-manage. Everything from bad grammar to shaky footage makes up a unique dialect an Influencer has crafted with their CITTA over thousands of posts. If you change the language, you’ll change the response.
BE OPEN: This platform is for Influencers, not celebrities. You may not recognize them, but rest assured their followers do. We believe accessing countless pockets of influence is far more meaningful than a large celebrity endorsement.
BE AWARE: Feel free to share an Influencer's post within the same social platform, however content cannot be used in any additional or other marketing material, nor should it be used outside of the original platform without getting their additional approval.
BE TRANSPARENT: Be aware of the need to be transparent when engaging with influencers, and the requirement to label influencer posts with #ad or #sponsored         to tell consumers that it is a paid for post.
HOUSE RULES FOR INFLUENCERS
BE TRANSPARENT: Keep up to speed with the latest developments and best practice on how to label your posts in a transparent way to show that it is paid for by the brand. Normally, that will mean labeling your content with #SPONSOREDPOST in your content. Don’t try to hide the fact that the content is paid for; both you and the brand will lose credibility if you do.
BE GENEROUS: Post must stay on the top of your feed for a minimum 5 hours and on your platform for 30 days.
BE AUTHENTIC: If you wouldn't recommend the brand for free - don't recommend it for money.
BE GENUINE: We work exclusively with Influencers who’ve organically grown their audience. If you’re misrepresenting the size of your audience or engagement in your content, we reserve the right to terminate your CITTA account.
BE MINDFUL: If you’re seen to be recommending competing brands in quick succession or over-populating your feed with sponsored posts, you’ll lose credibility with your CITTA.

You will not have an opportunity to edit a Post after a Brand has approved the Post. You agree you are solely responsible for the publication of Posts. CITTA merely provides a service allowing Brands to approve Posts before publication.
In relation to Content Only Campaigns, once Paid Content has been approved by a Brand, you agree that you must not share the Paid Content on your Channels or elsewhere unless stipulated by the Brand.
Before receiving any Payments, you will be asked to provide financial details including your nominated bank account or UPI/Wallet account details, PAN Number. TDS will be applicable as per India’s income tax rules.

Influencers must clearly disclose in sponsored Posts their relationship with the Brand. CITTA requires that you make such disclosures in such a way so that it is clear to the ordinary consumer viewing your Channels that there is a commercial relationship between Influencer and the Brand.

You agree that all right, title and interest in all Intellectual Property Rights in Paid Content is absolutely and unconditionally assigned to CITTA on the terms and conditions stated in the Content Rights Terms document, upon payment to you of the Paid Content Fee.
